# Preparations - Intro to Git/GitHub Contributor training

## Participator

All participants need to follow the steps below *before* the training. This is an interactive training so it is important that all participants follow all these instruction and bring their laptop to the training.

1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Guides/Creating-GitHub-account.md) to sign up

2. Please send your GitHub username to the organizer or the instructor for your training session. (If you signed up for this training using a form where you indicated your username - then you do not need to share it again.) The instructor will then invite you to the training repository. You will need to accept that invitation in order to participate in the training. 

3. [Download and install the software GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is a Github Client that is free to download. There are other Github clients but this training uses GitHub Desktop as it is the best client for beginners. After you have installed it, open it and log in using your GitHub account at least once.

4. Bring the computer where you installed GitHub Desktop to the training

## Organizer

#### When planning the training:

* If people are attending remotely: Set up a 120 min call using any of the Teams, Zoom, WebEx etc.
* If people are attending in person: Make sure that the room is a VC room with a screen
* If people are attending both remotely and in person, do both of the above!
* Send the link to this page to all participants asking them to follow the _Participator_ instructions. Copy the instructor in that email.

#### A day or two before the training:

* Make sure that all participants has a GitHub account and has the Git Client GitHub Desktop installed.
* Make sure that you have forwarded to the instructor all the GitHub account names that participants have sent to you.
* Make sure that all participants are aware that this is an interactive training where it only make sense if everyone brings their own computer to the training.

## Instructor

#### When planning the training:

* Send this page to the organizer of the training if that is a different person than the instructor.

#### A day or two before the training:

* Run the jupyter notebook code to set up the training repo
* Invite all participants to the training repo

#### Day of training:

* Check how many people accepted the invitation. If almost all accepted, then follow up at beginning of training, otherwise follow up by email as too much time will be spent doing this at the training.
* Make sure that you do not have the test repo, or another repo with the same name, already cloned to your computer
