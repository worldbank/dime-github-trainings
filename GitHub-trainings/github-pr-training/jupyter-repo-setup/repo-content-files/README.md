# Intro to Git and GitHub training - Contributor

This repository was created for a training session of [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) *Intro to Git and GitHub Training - Contributor*. You can read more about DIME Analytics Git and GitHub trainings [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).

This is one of two beginner trainings. This one is for *Contributors*: people that will make code contributions and provide feedback using Git/GitHub. You can read more about Contributors and other roles in DIME Analytics [Suggested GitHub Project Roles](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Roles/DIME-GitHub-roles.md).

## About this training

This training targets both absolute beginners and people with some Git/GitHub experience who want to learn best practices for contributing to a project using Git/GitHub. This training will not teach you everything about Git and GitHub, but after this training you will know how to contribute to a repository.

The training is designed for someone joining a team that is already using Git/GitHub, or that is about to start, and has a team member that is experience with GitHub workflows. This training will not teach you how to create a repository, how to set up work flows and best practices for a team using Git/GitHub, or how to solve conflicts etc. in a repository. However, you will be able to figure out most of them yourself after this training, if you are willing to use Google a little bit.

We hope you like Git as much as we do!

## Content in this repository

While Git/GitHub is a tool primarily for code development, there will be no code during this training. In our experience, code distracts participants (as they want to find out what it is trying to do), and the training applies regardless of intended programming language. So this training is 100% programming language agnostic and has no requirement of coding skills.

Instead we will create an archive of great song lyrics. We will add lyrics to this repository in .txt files. We use that file format as it will behave the same way as any code file, but without distracting us.

## Doing this training on your own

This training was developed to be an interactive training taught by an instructor, but we are happy to share all material. If you are not participating in an in-person session and want to do this training on your own, go to [DIME Analytics GitHub training repo](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings). There, you find the [LaTeX](https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates) code to generate the slides used in this training, and the jupyter notebook code that you can run to create your own copy of this repository that you can interact with.
