# PR-training - Exercise

This exercise covers some of the topics in [DIME Analytic's GitHub PR training](https://osf.io/umqzn/).

## Import the training repo

We have prepared a repo you will work in, but first you need to copy it to your account. Follow these instructions to do so:

1. Go to https://github.com/new/import
2. Use `https://github.com/dime-worldbank/gh-pr-ex-repo` in the URL field
3. You can name your repo whatever you want, but it might be easier to follow these instructions if you keep the name `gh-pr-ex-repo`
4. You can make the repo either _private_ or _public_
5. Then click `Begin import`
6. Wait until the import is done and then click the link when it says that your new repo is ready.

### Invite someone to your repo (optional)

You can do these exercises by yourself and be both the _author_ role and the _reviewer_ role. But you can also pair up with someone and invite each other to the repos so you can be different roles on each other's repos. To invite someone, follow the steps below. All you must replace `<username>` with your GitHub username in all URLs below.

1. Go to `https://github.com/<username>/gh-pr-ex-repo/settings/access`
2. Click `Invite a collaborator`
3. Enter the GitHub username of the person you paired up with and click to add them to the repository
4. They will be sent an email from GitHub, but you can also send them this link `https://github.com/<username>/gh-pr-ex-repo/invitations` and ask them to click it.

They are succesfully added to your repo when their status no longer says "_Pending invite_".
