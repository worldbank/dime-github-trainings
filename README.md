## Training overview
Please contact dimeanalytics@worldbank.org if you want to discuss how we can hold this training for you and your team.

These trainings have been developed with [DIME Analytics' GitHub role division model](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-roles.md) in mind. That model is a template for how to organize a research team on GitHub and the training materials in this repository is intended to match that model.

While most of the training material is developed as interactive trainings led by an instructor, we are still happy to share all material in case it might be useful to anyone.

See the [GitHub trainings README](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/dime-github-trainings/tree/master/GitHub-trainings) for more detail.
