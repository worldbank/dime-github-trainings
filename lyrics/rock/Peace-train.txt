Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides the peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on now, peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on now, peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends too
Because it's getting nearer
It soon will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on now peace train
Peace train
Now I've been crying lately
Thinkin' about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating?
Why can't we live in bliss?
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on now, peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on, come on, come on
Yes, come on, peace train
Yes, it's the peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
Come on now, peace train
Oh, peace train
Ooh-ah, ee-ah, ooh-ah
