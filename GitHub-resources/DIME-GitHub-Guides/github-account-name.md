# How to get your GitHub account name

Your GitHub account name and the email address associated with
your GitHub account name are two different things.

## Follow these steps to get your username

### 1. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub

Go to www.github.com. 
If it says `Sign in`/`Sign up` at the top right corner of the webpage, 
then you are not logged in. 
If you are not logged in, then please log in to GitHub.

### 2. Find your profile page

When you are logged in, 
you will see a round button with your profile picture 
at the top right corner of the webpage. 
If you never set up a profile picture for your account 
you will have a autogenerated avatar profile picture.
That's ok, but maybe take a look at 
[these user account best practices](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/main/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Guides/Creating-GitHub-account.md#best-practice-settings) 
after you are done following these steps.

Click your profile picture button and select `Your profile` in the menu that pops up.

### 3. Get your account name from the URL

You will see your account name on this page. 
However, to make sure you do not confuse your display name with your account name, 
look at the URL. 
It will have this format `https://github.com/<username>` 
where `<username>` will correspond to your user account name.

Copy that part of your profile URL and share that with whoever are asking for your account username.
