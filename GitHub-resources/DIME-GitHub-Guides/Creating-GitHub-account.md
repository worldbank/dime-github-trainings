# Creating a GitHub account

Creating an account is easy. You can do so by following [this link](https://github.com/join), but we recommend that you read through the best practices below first.

## Best practice creating account

1. **Use a private email address** - We have had colleagues who has lost access to their GitHub account after losing access to work email when changing jobs, so use a personal email when you create your account. This will be your primary email. You can later add your work email and have any notifications from work repositories sent to that email.

2. **No need for multiple accounts** - Most people use the same account, even when working for different organization or for personal projects like hosting a web site. So, if you already have a GitHub account, there is no need to create a second one.

## Best practice settings

Here are some optional settings that we have found to be helpful to teams to be productive on GitHub:

### Profile picture
Let's not turn GitHub into another social media platform, but there is one good reason why everyone should replace the automatically generated profile picture with a picture of their choice. Note that the picture of choice does not need to be a picture of the user, it can be a pic of a pet, a cartoon, a nature image or anything else that is unique among all other users you are working with.

Once a team is actively using GitHub to manage a research project it will be much faster to scan through discussions and commit histories if everyone uses a profile picture unique to them. This will increase the productivity in the team, especially for managers and repo maintainers that need to keep an overview of what is going on and who is doing what in a repo.

To update your profile picture, go to https://github.com/settings/profile in a browser where you are logged in to github.com.

### Notifications
In this digital age, very few things are more annoying than more notifications. You can turn off all notifications but we strongly encourage you to not turn off all notification and instead learn how you control your notifications.

##### Watching
_Watching_ a repository is like _following_ it. There are four different levels of watching. _Watching_, _Releases only_, _Not watching_, and _Ignoring_. By default you are _Not watching_ all repositories. You can change your level for a repository by browsing to that repository at github.com and select your new watching level at the top right of the page. When you are given write access to a repository you are automatically _Watching_ that repository.

* **_Watching_**: You get notifications when a new version is released, a new issue or pull request is open, etc. or you are mentioned (like `@your_username`) in a comment anywhere in this repository.
* **Releases only**: You get notifications only when a new version is released or you are mentioned (like `@your_username`) in a comment anywhere in this repository.
* **_Not Watching_**: You only get notifications when you are mentioned (like `@your_username`) in a comment anywhere in this repository.
* **_Ignore_**: You never get any notifications from this repository, not even when you are mentioned (like `@your_username`) in a comment, anywhere in this repository.

##### Send notification to work repositories to your work email

If you used a private email (as we recommended) when you sat up your GitHub account you can add your work email as your second email. Then you can tell GitHub to send all notifications from repositories hosted at your employer's organization account to be sent to that email.

To do that, follow these steps.

* **Add a second email**
  1. Go to https://github.com/settings/profile in a browser where you are logged in to github.com
  1. Click emails in the menu (or click here https://github.com/settings/emails)
  1. In the field that says _Add email address_ enter the email you want to add as your second email. An email will be sent to that address with instructions for how to confirm that you own that email. Complete those instructions before doing next step.
* **Set up notification for the second email**
  1. After you have added a second email, click _Notifications_ in the settings menu (or click here https://github.com/settings/notifications, link only works if you are logged in to GitHub.com).
  1. Make sure that you have the email box selected in the _Participating_ and _Watching_ section.
  1. Then scroll down to the _Custom routing_ section where you can select which email  GitHub will send notifications from repositories hosted in organization accounts.
