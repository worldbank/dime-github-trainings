# Creating a GitHub account

Creating an account is easy. You can do so by following [this link](https://github.com/join), but we recommend that you read through the best practices below first.

## Best practice creating account

1. **Use a private email address** - We have had colleagues who has lost access to their GitHub account after losing access to work email when changing jobs, so use a personal email when you create your account. This will be your primary email. You can later add your work email and have any notifications from work repositories sent to that email.

2. **No need for multiple accounts** - Most people use the same account, even when working for different organization or for personal projects like hosting a web site. So, if you already have a GitHub account, there is no need to create a second one.

## Best practice settings

Here are some optional settings that we have found to be helpful to teams to be productive on GitHub:

### Profile picture
Let's not turn GitHub into another social media platform, but there is one good reason why everyone should replace the automatically generated profile picture with a picture of their choice. Note that the picture of choice does not need to be a picture of the user, it can be a pic of a pet, a cartoon, a nature image or anything else that is unique among all other users you are working with.

Once a team is actively using GitHub to manage a research project it will be much faster to scan through discussions and commit histories if everyone uses a profile picture unique to them. This will increase the productivity in the team, especially for managers and repo maintainers that need to keep an overview of what is going on and who is doing what in a repo.

To update your profile picture, go to https://github.com/settings/profile in a browser where you are logged in to github.com.

### Notifications
In this digital age, very few things are more annoying than more notifications. You can turn off all notifications but we strongly encourage you to not turn off all notification and instead learn how you control your notifications.

##### Watching
Each repository has notification settings. You can see the options by clicking the _Watching_ button at the top of the repo page. You can there customize your notifications for each repo there. Be careful to ignore all notifications as you might miss information, but feel free to set the settings to get fewer notification than the default value.


##### Send notification to work repositories to your work email

If you used a private email (as we recommended) when you sat up your GitHub account you can add your work email as your second email. Then you can tell GitHub to send all notifications from repositories hosted at your employer's organization account to be sent to that email.

To do that, follow these steps.

* **Add a second email**
  1. Go to https://github.com/settings/profile in a browser where you are logged in to github.com
  1. Click emails in the menu (or click here https://github.com/settings/emails)
  1. In the field that says _Add email address_ enter the email you want to add as your second email. An email will be sent to that address with instructions for how to confirm that you own that email. Complete those instructions before doing next step.
* **Set up notification for the second email**
  1. After you have added a second email, click _Notifications_ in the settings menu and then click _Custom Routing_ (or click here https://github.com/settings/notifications/custom_routing, link only works if you are logged in to GitHub.com).
  1. Select the origanization accounts for which you want notifications sent to your second email. Any notification for any repo or project hosted on the account you select for the second email will be sent to that email.
